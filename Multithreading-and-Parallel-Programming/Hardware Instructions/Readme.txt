Instructions for creating input text file:

1. The execution of the program needs an input text file.
2. The input file should have four arguments n, k, c1 and c2.
3. Here n represents the number of threads used to compare the mutual exclusion algorithms.
4. And k represents the number of times that each thread will attempt to enter the critical section.
5. And c1 and c2 are the average times of the exponential decay distribution used to stimulate the times of the   critical section and remainder section respectively.
6. The four arguments can be typed either with a space in between or in different lines.

Instructions for executing Assgn3-Src-tas-ES21BTECH11022.cpp :

1. First compile the c++ file via the command "g++ Assgn3-Src-tas-ES21BTECH11022.cpp"/.
2. This creates the output file a.out.
3. To execute the code use the command "./a.out <name>.txt".
4. The output would be a text file.
5. The Output file will contain the following details:
    a)The time at which request to enter CS is given for each thread each of the k times.
    b)The time at which the thread enters the CS.
    c)The time at which the thread exits the CS.

Instructions for executing Assgn3-Src-cas-ES21BTECH11022.cpp :

1. First compile the c++ file via the command "g++ Assgn3-Src-cas-ES21BTECH11022.cpp"/.
2. This creates the output file a.out.
3. To execute the code use the command "./a.out <name>.txt".
4. The output would be a text file.
5. The Output file will contain the following details:
    a)The time at which request to enter CS is given for each thread each of the k times.
    b)The time at which the thread enters the CS.
    c)The time at which the thread exits the CS.
