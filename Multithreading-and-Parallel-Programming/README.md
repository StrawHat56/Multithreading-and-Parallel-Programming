# Multithreading-and-Parallel-Programming
Different experiments to study about Multithreading and Parallel Programming. 
The following experiments are done in the study:

1)Parallelizing Monte Carlo's Method to calculate pi using threads:
    In the analysis we see the change in running time to calculate pi with change in number of threads.

2)Created a parallel sudoku validator and compared pthreads and OpenMP threads:
    In the analysis we again check change in time with change in number of threads but also compare OpenMP threads and PThreads.

3)Comparing different hardware instructions provided for synchronization:
    In the analysis we check the average waiting time for the thread using each hardware instruction against number of threads.
    
4)A Jurassic Park simulation to test synchronization using semaphores:
    In the analysis we check the average tour time against number of threads and the average ride time against number of threads.
