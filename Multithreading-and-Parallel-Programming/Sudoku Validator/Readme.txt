Instructions for executing Assgn2Srcpthread-ES21BTECH11022.c :

1. First compile the c file via the command "gcc Assgn2Srcpthread-ES21BTECH11022.c -lm"/.
2. This creates the output file a.out.
3. To execute the code use the command "./a.out <name>.txt".
4. The output would be a text file.
5. The Output file will contain the following details:
    a)Log files for each thread.
    b)Whether the sudoku is valid or invalid.
    c)Time taken to execute each thread.
