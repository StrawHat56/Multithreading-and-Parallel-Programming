Instructions for creating input text file:

1. The execution of the program needs an input text file.
2. The input file should have five arguments p, c, lambda_p, lambda_c and k.
3. Here p represents the number of passenger threads used in reacreating the Jurassic Park Problem.
4. And c represents the number of car threads.
5. And lambda_p and lambda_c are the average times of the exponential decay distribution used to stimulate the wait time between two ride requests and ride times respectively.
6. And finally k represents the number of times that a passenger requests a ride.
7. The five arguments can be typed either with a space in between or in different lines.

Instructions for executing Assgn4-Src-ES21BTECH11022.cpp :

1. First compile the c file via the command "gcc Assgn4-Src-ES21BTECH11022.cpp".
2. This creates the output file a.out.
3. To execute the code use the command "./a.out <name>.txt".
4. The output would be a text file.
5. The Output file will contain the following details for each passenger:
    i) The time at which each of the p passengers enters the museum.
    ii) The time at which a passenger requests a ride.
    iii) The time at which the request is accepted.
    iv) The time at which the ride finishes.
    v) The time when the passenger exits the museum.
